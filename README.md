Hello and welcome to WordFold!

I am unsure if I accidentally installed anything weird/out of the ordinary so i included the package.json file in my IP.2 submission just to be safe.

Sometimes testing for coverage (npm run test -- --coverage) includes more files than it should, which skews the all files test case coverage. I included a screenshot of running my test cases when the correct files were included.
