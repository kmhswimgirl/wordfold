<h1>Welcome to WordFold!</h1>

WordFold is a word game that is coded in Typescript using Next.js as a framework. The objective of the game is to create words by "folding" the letters into each other.

To begin, choose a configuration using the puzzle buttons and select a square on the board. Next, click one of the four arrow buttons to merge the selected contents in that direction. The selected contents will always be placed in front of the contents of the square that is being merged into.

Scoring is based on correct moves. Each time a move is made, the score will update. It is the sum of all letters involved in correct moves.
